        <h2>Twitter</h2>
        <p>Twitter is an online news and social networking site where people communicate in short messages called tweets. Tweeting is posting short messages for anyone who follows you on Twitter, with the hope that your words are useful and interesting to someone in your audience. Another description of Twitter and tweeting might be microblogging.</p>

        <h2>Tumblr</h2>
        <p>Tumblr is a blogging and social media tool that allows users to publish a "tumblelog", or short blog posts. Tumblr's major differentiator is the free-form nature of the site and the ability of users to heavily customize their own pages. This is the exception to the rule, as nearly all other social networks have standardized profile pages with limited design flexibility.</p>
